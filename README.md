# Text_normalization

### The project

This project consists on an implementation of an encoder-decoder LSTM neural network to perform text-to-speech normalization (convert a written sentence to a spoken form) with deep learning. It is based on the Kaggle competition **Google Text Normalization Challenge** that provides a research paper and a dataset in which we can find english and russian words (to work on both language), I only worked on the english language to make things a bit easier.
